## üìö Tech Stack

-   [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms.

-   [BLoC Architecture](https://medium.com/flutter-community/bloc-architecture-why-so-important-d9b29f06680e) - Its a state management system for Flutter recommended by Google developers. It helps in managing state and make access to data from a central place in your project.

-   [RxDart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart) - RxDart is an implementation of the popular reactiveX api for asynchronous programming, leveraging the native Dart Streams api.

## üõ† Architecture

The Business Logic Component (BLoC) pattern is a pattern created by Google and announced at Google I/O ‚Äô18. The BLoC pattern uses Reactive Programming to handle the flow of data within an app.

A BLoC stands as a middleman between a source of data in your app (e.g an API response) and widgets that need the data. It receives streams of events/data from the source, handles any required business logic and publishes streams of data changes to widgets that are interested in them.

A BLoC has two simple components: Sinks and Streams, both of which are provided by a StreamController. You add streams of event/data input into a Sink and listen to them as streams of data output through a Stream.

A StreamController can be accessed via the ```dart:async``` library or as a ```PublishSubject```, ```ReplaySubject``` or ```BehaviourSubject``` via the rxdart package.

## üîë Configuration

In order to run this project, you need to get a **API-key** from  [FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/). Set this key to the constant ```API_KEY``` in ```constants.dart``` to run the app.
